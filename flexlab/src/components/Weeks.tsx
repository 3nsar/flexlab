            <p className='text-lg mt-5 text-gray-400'>Through experience, we've found that six weeks is the sweet spot. It's long enough to deliver a meaningful MVP, but short enough to avoid endless revisions and delays. 
                                                        It strikes the perfect balance between progress and momentum.

            <p className='text-lg mt-5 text-gray-400'>Our process is simple: We start with a call, prioritize the essential features, and focus on what we can build within six weeks. 
                                                        By the end, you'll have a working MVP ready for market testing. If you're happy with the results
